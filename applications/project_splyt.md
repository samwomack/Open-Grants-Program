##  Project Overview :page_facing_up:

###  Overview

Spl.yt Core is an innovative response and solution to the many pleas for change, revolutionizing the e-commerce market. Splyt enables brands to grow their brands in a direct-to-consumer model with the benefits and audience growth.

eNFT and e-commerce need high demand for transactions. We will use Polkadot’s high frequency blockchain as parachain and relay chains to speed up Splyt

Today’s e-commerce market is the fastest growing industry poised to hit $7.5 Trillion by 2025, which is oligopolistic where few large players dominate the market. Yet no major player efficiently controls the market’s full end-to-end supply chain systems. For that, online-sellers should bear unnecessary intermediary costs and cumbersome to list their products and manage them across multiple online marketplaces. Additionally, affiliate marketing is riddled with fraud and bot click-through.

Splyt aims to resolve such paint points lingering long enough in the e-commerce marketplace and its supply chain. Splyt’s blockchain NFT inventory database, powered by polkadot-based network protocol, will enable sellers to make effortless and transparent sales, streamline multi-platform affiliate sales, and eliminate liability between e-commerce platforms and supply chains.

Splyt aims to create a more transparent marketplace that better supports the growth of brands and levels the playing field for emerging brands. Splyt focuses on consumer habits, the growth and continuity of decentralized e-commerce, and creating a digital landscape that supports the growth of brands. This focus is especially critical with the pandemic-driven rush to move online.

##  Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

  

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions it should be clear how the project is related to Substrate and/or Polkadot. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone.

  

For each milestone:

*  Please be sure to include a specification of your software. Treat it as a contract - the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.

To assist you in defining it, we created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../src/grant_guidelines_per_category.md).

*  Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone.

*  Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.

*  Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.

*  Please commit to providing a dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.

*  Please indicate the milestone duration, as well as number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, and include the number of days along with their cost per day.

*  Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory and should not be removed, unless you explicitly specify a reason within the PR's `Additional Notes` section (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test)

  

###  Overview

*  **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)

*  **Full-time equivalent (FTE):** Workload of an employed person ([see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent)) (e.g. 2 FTE)

*  **Total Costs:** Amount of Payment in BTC or DAI for the whole project. The total amount of funding needs to be below $30k for initial grants and $100k for follow-up grants at the time of submission. (e.g. 0.80 BTC)

  

###  Milestone 1 Example — Implement Substrate Modules

*  **Estimated Duration:** 1 month

*  **FTE:** 1

*  **Costs:** 0.75 BTC

  

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |

| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |

| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicense |

| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works. |

| 0c. | Testing Guide | The code will have unit-test coverage (min. 70%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide we will describe how to run these tests |

| 0d. | Article/Tutorial | We will write an article or tutorial that explains the work done as part of the grant.

| 1. | Substrate module: X | We will create a Substrate module that will... (Please list the functionality that will be coded for the first milestone) |

| 2. | Substrate module: Y | We will create a Substrate module that will... |

| 3. | Substrate module: Z | We will create a Substrate module that will... |

| 4. | Substrate chain | Modules X, Y & Z of our custom chain will interact in such a way... (Please describe the deliverable here as detailed as possible) |

| 5. | Docker | We will provide a dockerfile to demonstrate the full functionality of our chain |

##  Future Plans

Ultimate goal is to make Splyt self-sustained, with income, employees (open source development and governance). And for the protocol to be used by any big and small companies. With any changes coming from users and shop owner’s vision.
